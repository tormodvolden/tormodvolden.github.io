<em>Note: The contents of your SD card can easily be destroyed by mistakes and bugs, so don't use it for valuable data!</em>

<p>Please use SDHC cards, since they have the most complete support (in SDBOOT, FUZIX, NitrOS-9).</p>

<p>
The software for the MOOH is written to the card using a raw write utility.
If you are unsure about what to use, the <a href="https://etcher.io">Etcher</a> program is recommended and is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows.
This program tries to help you make sure you are not inadvertently writing to the wrong device.
If on the other hand you know what you are doing, and find a 50 MB GUI program a bit of an overkill for this task,
you can use for instance <code>rawcopy.exe</code> from <a href="http://www.ltr-data.se/opencode.html/">LTR Data</a> on Windows or <code>dd</code> on Linux or Mac.
</p>

<p>
<em>If you write to the wrong device, i.e. your hard drive instead of the SD card, you're in for a lot of trouble!</em>
</p>

<h2>Using Etcher</h2>
The Etcher program is very simple to use, just start it and select the SD card image (you don't even need to unzip the downloaded file), select the SD card (most likely the only choice to come up), and click the Flash button.

<h2>For advanced Linux users</h2>
The "dd" command is the Swiss knife for all raw device and image manipulation:
<blockquote>
<code>dd if=sdcard.img of=/dev/mmcblk0</code>
</blockquote>
Depending on drivers and existing partitions the SD card will appear as /dev/mmcblk0 or for instance /dev/sdc. Use for instance "dmesg" to find out. Make sure to write to the raw device and not a partition, that is, not /dev/mmcblk0p1 nor /dev/sdc1.

<h2>For advanced Windows users</h2>
To identify the name of the SD card raw device, run:
<blockquote>
<code>wmic diskdrive list brief</code>
</blockquote>
Then use rawcopy.exe to write the image onto the SD card. Replace "PhysicalDrive1" below with the correct drive name!
<blockquote>
<code>
rawcopy sdcard.img \\.\PhysicalDrive1
</code>
</blockquote>
Or if you use Git Bash or another UNIX/POSIX shell on Windows:
<blockquote>
<code>
./rawcopy sdcard.img '\\.\PhysicalDrive1'
</code>
</blockquote>
