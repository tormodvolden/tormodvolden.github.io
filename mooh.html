<p>
The MOOH is a cartridge board for the Dragon and CoCo 1/2 featuring:

<ul>
<li> 512 KB RAM, handled by a DAT (dynamic address translator) compatible with the Tandy CoCo 3</li>
<li> SPI interface with 4 slaves, one connected to the micro-SD card slot</li>
<li> ROM socket for 27C512 type EPROMs (64KB)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The board is designed to allow Dragon and CoCo 1/2 computers to run multitasking operating system such as NitrOS-9 Level-2 and FUZIX, offering virtual address spaces for each process, as well as fast mass storage on SD cards. Other SPI devices can also be connected. The ROM socket acts like a standard cartridge ROM, additionally offering software selection of multiple ROM images. 
</p>
<p><em>
The board is currently undergoing beta testing and the final version should be available late 2017, at the price of 50 USD plus shipping. Pre-orders can be made at 
<img src="dragon-tormod-email.png" alt="spam-protected e-mail address" style="vertical-align: middle;">
(no payment is taken before the boards are ready to ship).
</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Plugs into the cartridge port - without modification of the computer</li>
<li>Dimensions ca 10 x 10 cm</li>
<li>Uses standard micro-SD cards</li>
</ul>

The board comes with a printed manual with programming details, schematics and internal logic code.

<h3>NitrOS-9</h3>
NitrOS-9 is an advanced multi-tasking operating system for 6809-based system, with roots in the original OS-9 in the 1980's.

OS-9 Level 2 was originally written for the Tandy CoCo 3 and to take advantage of its 128 KB (or 512 KB when upgraded) of RAM. An experimental port of NitrOS-9 Level 2 for the MOOH is available. Note that programs using the extended graphic modes of the CoCo 3 will not be able to run on your Dragon or CoCo 1/2.

<h3>FUZIX</h3>
FUZIX is a UNIX-like operating system that currently is being developed for a range of 8-bit microcomputer systems from the 1980's. Dragon is a first class citizen in FUZIX land, and is in combination with the MOOH board an excellent platform for this exciting operating system.

<h3>Other use</h3>
Your own machine language programs can access the 512 KB by mapping blocks of 8 KB into the CPU memory space. Potential applications include RAM disks and disk buffers.
