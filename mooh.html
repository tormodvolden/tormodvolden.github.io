</p>

<p><em>
The board is currently being made in smaller batches, so there can be some weeks of delivery time. (No payment is taken before the boards are ready to ship).
</em>
</p>

<p>
The MOOH is a cartridge board for the Dragon and CoCo 1/2 featuring:

<ul>
<li> 512 KB RAM, handled by a DAT (dynamic address translator) mostly software compatible with the DAT in the Tandy CoCo 3</li>
<li> SPI interface with 4 slaves, one connected to the micro-SD card slot</li>
<li> ROM socket for 27C512 type EPROMs (64KB)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The board is designed to allow Dragon and CoCo 1/2 computers to run multitasking operating system such as NitrOS-9 Level-2 and FUZIX, offering virtual address spaces for each process, as well as fast mass storage on SD cards. Other SPI devices can also be connected. The ROM socket acts like a standard cartridge ROM, additionally offering software selection of multiple ROM images.

A boot ROM allows the MOOH to be used without the need for any other storage devices or MPI. The "SDBOOT" ROM loads a program or operating system from the SD card on power-on.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugs into the cartridge port - without modification of the computer</li>
<li>Dimensions 99 x 96 mm (fits inside FD-502 and CoCoSDC enclosures)</li>
<li>Uses standard micro-SD cards</li>
</ul>

The board comes with a printed manual with programming details, schematics and internal logic code.

<h3>NitrOS-9</h3>
NitrOS-9 is an advanced multi-tasking operating system for 6809-based system, with roots in the original OS-9 in the 1980's.

OS-9 Level 2 was originally written for the Tandy CoCo 3 and to take advantage of its 128 KB (or 512 KB when upgraded) of RAM. An experimental port of NitrOS-9 Level 2 for the MOOH is available. Note that programs using the extended graphic modes of the CoCo 3 will not be able to run on your Dragon or CoCo 1/2.

<h3>FUZIX</h3>
FUZIX is a UNIX-like operating system that currently is being developed for a range of 8-bit microcomputer systems from the 1980's. Dragon is a first class citizen in FUZIX land, and is in combination with the MOOH board an excellent platform for this exciting operating system.

<h3>Other use</h3>
Your own machine language programs can access the 512 KB by mapping blocks of 8 KB into the CPU memory space. Potential applications include RAM disks and disk buffers.

<p>
<em>Please note that the MOOH board does not turn your CoCo 1 or CoCo 2 into a CoCo 3. In addition to the expanded memory unit, the CoCo 3 also has extended graphics modes and interrupt handling. Programs made for the CoCo 3 will not always run on the MOOH, especially those using graphics.
